                    My name is Riley Allred. I am 21 years old, and I currently live in Clearfield UT. I have lived in Utah my entire life, and I grew up having a huge interest in computers and how they work.
                    I completed the UofU web development bootcamp in May of 2023, and learned all of the industry standards for web design.
                    As far as interests go outside of web dev, I enjoy video games, TV shows, YouTube videos, memes, and just browsing the internet in general.
                    I will sometimes break out my drawing tablet and draw too, if I'm feeling like it. I am a member of a few online communities,
                    and have good friends all over the US.
